				<h1>Exciting Work -> Failing -> Learning the right way</h1>
				<p>During my four years as a Computer Science Engineering student, I dedicated myself to learning a wide range of skills that helped me grow both academically and personally. I gained a solid foundation in core computer science concepts such as algorithms, data structures, operating systems, and databases, which sharpened my problem-solving abilities.</p>
				<p>In addition to theoretical knowledge, I developed hands-on expertise in programming languages like C++, Java, and Python through various projects and coding challenges. I also explored emerging technologies, including artificial intelligence, machine learning, and web development, which further fueled my passion for innovation.</p>
				<p>Throughout this period, I took part in hackathons, workshops, and internships, which gave me real-world experience in applying technical skills to solve complex problems. Working in teams taught me the value of collaboration, while individual projects honed my ability to work independently and manage time effectively. Constantly learning new tools and technologies, I developed an adaptive mindset and cultivated a passion for staying updated with industry trends, preparing me for a dynamic career in technology.</p>
				<blockquote><p>"Starting a new project is a lot like swimming. Initially you feel excited and motivated to work and learn new things. Few miles down, you feel the reality of the work, and want to give up. But there is no going back in the middle of the lake. The end again becomes excited and hopeful and makes everything worthwhile" ~Me</p></blockquote>

				<h1>Current Engagement</h1>
				<p>Currently I am struggling with the heavy load of IIIT curriculum. Barely submitting assignments on time, and struggling to understand math courses. Hopefully once first semester is over, I would get some time to pursue some new and adventurous thing. The challenging courses and heavy load of assignments in my M.Tech program have been both intense and rewarding. While the complexity of the subjects pushes me to my limits, it is through this rigorous process that I am gaining a deeper understanding of advanced concepts. Each assignment demands critical thinking and perseverance, teaching me not only technical skills but also valuable life lessons like time management, problem-solving, and resilience. The experience is shaping my ability to approach difficulties methodically, preparing me for real-world challenges both in my career and personal growth.</p>
